Jumpstart Observations
1. No mic for the hosts and speakers
   * Noticed some freshies falling asleep maybe because they were not able to hear the speaker clearly
   * Some upperclassmen were noisy while the speakers were talking (No mic + background noise made it much harder for the      audience to hear the speaker) 
2. The speaker line-up as well as the hosts were A+.
3. Good that there were more volunteers than the freshies -- It helped in hyping up the event
4. Some amazing race materials were not prepared beforehand. Saw some volunteers doing (small) last-minute preparations    prior to the start of the amazing race. 
5. Saw some freshies smiled when they received the loot bag. 
6. From the perspective of the participants/audience, I believe Jumpstart 2017 was a big success.
